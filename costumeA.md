# Choose the costumes

## Step 1
Now that you found all the costume pieces, use the ``||hoc2024:head, body, and legs||`` block to create the 3 costumes the NPC is looking for. The order of the customes doesn't matter as long as they are 3 full sets.

#### ~ tutorialhint
The 3 sets of costumes the NPC is looking for are: ``||hoc2024:Cowboy||``, ``||hoc2024:Astronaut||``, and ``||hoc2024:Knight||``.
