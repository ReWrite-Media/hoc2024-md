# Choreograph a Dance

## Dance Instructor Welsen's Challenge @unplugged
Help Instructor Welsen finish choreographing their dance return. Let's first learn all the dance moves.

[SOME DANCING GIF]

## Choreographing the dance
The function *hoc.dance()* is used to set the dance move you want performed. It takes a single parameter that defines the move. 

Available parameters are:
Dance.Move1 (golem gallop), Dance.Move2 (wither wave), Dance.Move3 (shulker shuffle), Dance.Move4 (mushroom march)


```python-template
hoc.dances(Dances.Move1)
hoc.dances(Dances.Move2)
hoc.dances(Dances.Move3)
hoc.dances(Dances.Move4)
```

## Complete the Challenge 
Now that you know how to use the *hoc.dance()* function, see if you could figure out the order of the final 4 dance moves Instructor Welsen needs to finish his choreography.


```python-template
hoc.dances(Dances.Move1)
hoc.dances(Dances.Move2)
hoc.dances(Dances.Move3)
hoc.dances(Dances.Move4)
```

```package
hoc2024-ts=github:ReWrite-Media/hoc2024-ts/dance#v0.0.70
```
